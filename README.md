In this task you will bring the ArrayList implementation to one of the standard Java libraries.
Step 1. Implement the private grow method, which will be responsible for expanding the storage array by 1.5 times in a situation where the space has run out.

Step 2. Add a fullness check to the add method and, if the array is full, expand it.

Step 3. Change the sorting implementation to recursive from the last cheat sheet.

The choice of specific sorting is up to you.
